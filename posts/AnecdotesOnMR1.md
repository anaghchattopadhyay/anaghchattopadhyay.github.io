Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a powerful method in modern epidemiology that uses genetics to answer one of the most important questions in science: **Does X actually *cause* Y?** While traditional observational studies often struggle with confounding variables and reverse causation, MR provides a way to estimate causal effects by leveraging the random assortment of genes at conception.

At its core, MR treats genetic variants as **natural experiments**. Because the inheritance of genetic variants is essentially random—much like random assignment in a clinical trial—these variants can serve as *instruments* that shift an exposure (such as cholesterol levels or BMI) in predictable ways. If those genetically influenced differences lead to changes in an outcome (like heart disease or diabetes), we obtain evidence that the exposure is likely causal.
